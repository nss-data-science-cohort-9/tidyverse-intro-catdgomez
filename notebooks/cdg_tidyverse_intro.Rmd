This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r}

```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


1. Using the read_csv() function, read the GDP dataset into your notebook as a tibble called gdp_df. After reading it in, inspect the first 10 rows and then inspect the last 10 rows.


```{r}

gdp_df <- read_csv("../data/gdp_per_capita.csv")

head(gdp_df, 10)

```

```{r}
tail(gdp_df, 10)
```


2. Drop the 'Value Footnotes' column, and rename the remaining columns to 'Country', 'Year', and 'GDP_Per_Capita'.

```{r}

gdp_df_drop <- gdp_df |> 
  select(-`Value Footnotes`)


gdp_df_drop

```


```{r}

gdp_df_drop_rename <- gdp_df_drop |> 
  rename(c(GDP_Per_Capita = Value, Country = `Country or Area`))

gdp_df_drop_rename
```

3. Which years are represented in this dataset? 

```{r}
min(gdp_df_drop_rename[,2])
max(gdp_df_drop_rename[,2])
```

How many observations are there per year? 

```{r}
gdp_df_drop_rename |> 
  count(Year)
```

Make a plot to view the number of observations per year.

```{r}

```


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
